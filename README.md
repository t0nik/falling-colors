## Falling colors
An interactive webpage app made possible using React.js library with TypeScript language.

**Setup:** Clone the code. Make sure that Node.js is installed on your machine - then run *npm install* in terminal in order to download node packages. Run *npm start* to host the page locally.

**Goal:** Pick a color and hover your mouse cursor over the map to see colors fall through following tiles.

**Current state:** Hovering your mouse over a tile changes its color. Visualisation below.
